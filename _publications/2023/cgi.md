  We propose a novel PSD-driven technique that extends the ProtoSphere algorithm to achieve multi-sized sphere packing with distribution-specific characteristics, as dictated by a pre-defined cumulative distribution function. Our method improves the controllability and flexibility of the packing process, enabling users to generate packing configurations that meet their specific requirements.
