  We present a novel fully Lagrangian simulation framework that couples Bonded Discrete Element Method (BDEM) with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the complex interactions between elastic solids and fluids. While particle-based methods have shown success in fluid-solid interaction simulations, most existing approaches focus on rigid or granular materials. Our framework extends this capability to elastic solids that can undergo deformations, fracture, and topological changes. The BDEM component represents solids as particles connected by elastic bonds that can stretch, bend, shear, twist and break, while SPH handles fluid dynamics with free surface flows.
