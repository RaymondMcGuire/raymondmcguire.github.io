  This paper presents a prototype XR system for disaster medical response, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time interactive elastodynamics simulations in emergency scenarios. 
  The system delivers an end-to-end workflow utilizing XR technology, from on-site data acquisition to remote simulation.
  Specifically, we propose an image-guided mesh-processing pipeline that converts photographs of injured individuals into solver-ready tetrahedral meshes. 
  We also develop a constraint based elastodynamics solver capable of simulating deformable bodies and visualizing internal stresses.
  Additionally, the system integrates multiple advanced XR devices and addresses the coordinate-alignment problem between these devices and the simulator.
  We validate the system's performance in both AR/VR modes, under textured and stress-visualization configurations, and demonstrate its applicability for remote medical guidance. 
  Beyond whole-body elastic simulations, we conduct preliminary organ-level experiments to inform future remote surgical applications.
  This prototype, validated using a two-room setup, provides a feasible solution for remote emergency medical response.
